# Fees

> Understanding trading fees on Polymarket

Polymarket charges a small taker fee on certain markets. These fees fund the [Maker Rebates Program](/market-makers/maker-rebates), which redistributes fees daily to market makers to incentivize deeper liquidity and tighter spreads.

**Geopolitical and world events markets are fee-free.** Polymarket does not charge fees or profit from trading activity on these markets. There are also no Polymarket fees to deposit or withdraw USDC (though intermediaries like Coinbase or MoonPay may charge their own fees).

<Note>
  Fees apply only to markets deployed on or after the activation date. Pre-existing markets are unaffected. Markets with fees enabled have `feesEnabled` set to `true` on the market object.
</Note>

## Fee Structure

Fees are calculated using the following formula:

```text  theme={null}
fee = C × feeRate × (p × (1 - p))^exponent
```

Where **C** = number of shares traded and **p** = price of the shares.

**Makers are never charged fees.** Only takers pay fees. The fee parameters differ by market category:

Taker fees are calculated in USDC and vary based on the share price. However, fees are collected in shares on buy orders and USDC on sell orders. The fee amount in USDC is symmetric around 50% probability — a trade at 30¢ incurs the same dollar fee as a trade at 70¢.

    The fee in USDC **peaks at 50%** probability (\$1.56) and decreases symmetrically toward both extremes.

### Fee Precision

Fees are rounded to 5 decimal places. The smallest fee charged is **0.00001 USDC**. Anything smaller rounds to zero, so very small trades near the extremes may incur no fee at all.

## Identifying Fee-Enabled Markets

Markets with fees have `feesEnabled` set to `true` on the market object. You can also query the fee-rate endpoint to check any specific market. See the [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) for full endpoint documentation.

```bash  theme={null}
GET https://clob.polymarket.com/fee-rate?token_id={token_id}
```

## Fee Handling for API Users

### Using the SDK

The official CLOB clients **automatically handle fees** for you — they fetch the fee rate and include it in the signed order payload.

  <Card title="TypeScript" icon="js" href="https://github.com/Polymarket/clob-client">
    npm install @polymarket/clob-client\@latest
  </Card>

  <Card title="Python" icon="python" href="https://github.com/Polymarket/py-clob-client">

  </Card>

    cargo add polymarket-client-sdk
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**What the client does automatically:**

1. Fetches the fee rate for the market's token ID
2. Includes `feeRateBps` in the order structure
3. Signs the order with the fee rate included

**You don't need to do anything extra.** Your orders will work on fee-enabled markets.

### Using the REST API

If you're calling the REST API directly or building your own order signing, you must manually include the fee rate in your signed order payload.

**Step 1:** Fetch the fee rate for the token ID before creating your order:

```bash  theme={null}
GET https://clob.polymarket.com/fee-rate?token_id={token_id}
```

See the [fee-rate API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) for full response details. Fee-enabled markets return a non-zero value; fee-free markets return `0`.

**Step 2:** Add the `feeRateBps` field to your order object. This value is part of the signed payload — the CLOB validates your signature against it.
